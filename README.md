# 🧬 Disease Classification: TF-IDF vs. One-Hot Encoding

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Disease+Classification+TF-IDF+vs+One-Hot+Encoding)

This project evaluates how different feature encoding techniques (TF-IDF vs. One-Hot Encoding) impact disease classification performance using KNN and Logistic Regression, with dimensionality reduction via PCA/SVD.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project investigates:

- 🧪 Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** and **One-Hot Encoding**
- 🔽 Dimensionality reduction using **PCA** and **Truncated SVD**
- 🤖 Classification using **KNN** and **Logistic Regression**
- 📈 Performance comparison between encoding strategies

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes 20 diseases and their:

- ✅ Risk Factors (e.g., hypertension, smoking)
- 💢 Symptoms (e.g., chest pain, fatigue)
- 🧪 Signs (e.g., elevated blood pressure)
- 🧬 Subtypes (e.g., Type A Aortic Dissection)

**Files Used:**
- `disease_features.csv` – Original dataset
- `encoded_output2.csv` – One-hot encoded version

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🏷️ Feature Extraction
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from scipy.sparse import hstack

tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_risk = tfidf.fit_transform(df['Risk_Str'])
X_symptoms = tfidf.fit_transform(df['Symptoms_Str'])

X_tfidf = hstack([X_risk, X_symptoms])
```

### 🔽 Dimensionality Reduction
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA, TruncatedSVD

# For dense data
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_tfidf.toarray())

# For sparse matrix
svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=2)
X_svd = svd.fit_transform(X_tfidf)
```

### 🤖 Model Training
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric='cosine')
scores = cross_val_score(knn, X_tfidf, y, cv=5)
```
